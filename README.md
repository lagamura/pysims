My Thesis on MSc degree e-ce University of Thessaly

##Abstract

Simulations are widely accepted as a modern tool in e-learning and education, due to the fact of representing
complex processes and phenomena in a quality and engaging manner. Today, the various simulation software
are costly and hard to be used by tutors and students. For this reason, we develop a simulation learning platform
with modern tools, where users can easily run various models via a friendly interface, tutors can parameterize
the exposed variables of the model, while all the gathered data are stored appropriately in a database for further
analysis.

The Project is based in the open-source System Dynamics libray PySD (https://github.com/SDXorg/pysd)
Stack Information:
* PySD is used on the backend to calculate System Dynamics Models
* FastAPI is used as the backend framework, which is written in Python
* Vue 3 is used as the frontend framework with tools like ElementUI library and ChartJs for the graphs
